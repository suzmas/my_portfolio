This is going to be a post about Chrome's DevTools. I was supposed to do a tech talk on this, but I had no idea how deep the subject matter went. Tech talk ended up being about Jekyll, and even that was a botch job, but I'm going to start putting together a "tech talk" in the form of blog posts. This is mostly to teach myself to better use the Chrome DevTools, but hey, if it makes me look good to potential employers, that could be nice too.
